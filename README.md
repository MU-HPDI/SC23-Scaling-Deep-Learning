This paper discusses the scaling of three remote sensing imagery scientific applications utilizing Deep Learning on the NRP Nautilus Hyper Cluster.

## Scientific Applications

- [Object Detection with Transformers](./ObjectDetectionTransformers/README.md)
- [Burned Area Segmentation](./BurnedAreaSegmentation/README.md)
- [Deforestation Detection](./DeforestationDetection/README.md)

## Nautilus HyperCluster
The Nautilus HyperCluster is a distributed Kubernetes cluster available for research prototyping, scaling, and more.
